A Roman {2}-dominating function (R2DF) on a graph $G = (V,E)$ is defined as a function $f: V(G) \rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$, which satisfies the condition that for any vertex $u \in V$ having $f(u) = 0$, there is at least one vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$ where $f(v) = 2$ or there are at least two vertices $x$,$y$ adjacent to $u$ where $f(x) = f(y) = 1$.

The weight of a R2DF $f$ is the value $f(V) = \sum_{v \in V} f(v)$.The minimum weight of a R2DF $f$ on a graph G is the Roman {2}-domination number $\rdom(G)$. Finding $\rdom$ for a general graph $G$ is proved to be an NP-complete problem.

In this paper we will begin our discussion with upper bound and exact results obtained for $\rdom$ in some special classes of Graphs. In particular, we present the exact value of $\rdom$ in Square of Cycle Graphs ($C_{n^{2}}$) and Rook's Graph. We also give a tight upper bound of $\rdom$ in King's Graph.

Next we present a linear time dynamic programming algorithm for finding $\rdom(T)$ in a tree $T$.
