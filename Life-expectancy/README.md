# 📊 Statistical Analysis on Factors Influencing Life Expectancy (2022)

This project aims to uncover key socio-economic and health-related factors influencing global life expectancy using WHO and UN data. It employs statistical modeling and exploratory data analysis in **R** to generate actionable insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Identify major predictors of life expectancy across countries
- **Dataset:** WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) and United Nations
- **Tech Stack:** R programming, `ggplot2`, OLS Regression, correlation analysis
- **Data Size:** 1,649 records × 22 features (after cleaning)
- **Focus Year:** 2022

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Can we predict and explain variations in **life expectancy** based on a country’s health, education, and economic indicators?

Key questions explored:
- Should countries with low life expectancy increase healthcare expenditure?
- How do mortality rates (adult/infant) influence lifespan?
- What is the relationship between life expectancy and variables like alcohol, HIV/AIDS, or schooling?

---

## 🧮 Data Summary

- **Original Dataset Size:** 2,938 rows × 22 columns  
- **Cleaned Dataset:** 1,649 rows (after removing null/inconsistent values)
- **Key Features:**
  - `LifeExpectancy` (target)
  - `AdultMortality`, `InfantDeaths`, `HIV/AIDS`, `Alcohol`, `BMI`
  - `Schooling`, `IncomeCompositionOfResources`, `GDP`, `Population`
  - `Country`, `Status` (Developed/Developing, encoded)

---

## ⚙️ Preprocessing Steps

- Removed rows with excessive missing data (44% reduction)
- Encoded categorical variables:
  - `Status`: 0 = Developing, 1 = Developed
  - `Country`: Numerical encoding
- Normalized and cleaned feature names for consistency

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Performed pairwise correlation analysis
- Created scatterplots and heatmaps using `ggplot2`
- Identified top positively and negatively correlated variables with life expectancy

### 🔍 Observed Correlations:
| Feature                  | Correlation | Interpretation                         |
|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Income Composition       | +0.79       | Strong positive correlation             |
| Schooling                | +0.75       | Strong positive correlation             |
| HIV/AIDS                 | –0.56       | Strong negative correlation             |
| Adult Mortality          | –0.69       | Strong negative correlation             |
| BMI                      | +0.52       | Mild positive correlation               |

## 📊 Regression Modeling

- **Model Type:** Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression
- **Selected Features:**
  - `AdultMortality`
  - `IncomeCompositionOfResources`
  - `Schooling`
  - `HIV/AIDS`
  - `BMI`

### 📌 Final Regression Equation:

```

Life Expectancy = 52.28
\- 0.01 × Adult Mortality
\+ 12.24 × Income
\+ 0.97 × Schooling
\- 0.52 × HIV/AIDS
\+ 0.03 × BMI

```

- **R-squared:** 0.825
- **Adjusted R-squared:** 0.824

> Indicates a strong model fit explaining over 82% of the variance in life expectancy.

## 📉 Residual Diagnostics

- Residual and Q-Q plots reviewed
- Model assumptions were reasonably met
- Future work: address potential multicollinearity (VIF analysis not conducted during this phase)

---

## ✅ Key Findings

- **Top Positive Predictors:**
  - Income Composition of Resources
  - Schooling

- **Top Negative Predictors:**
  - HIV/AIDS prevalence
  - Adult Mortality

- **Not Significant:**
  - Alcohol consumption
  - Population density (not included in final model)

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

The analysis suggests that **improving education and economic equity** has a stronger long-term impact on life expectancy than healthcare expenditure alone. High mortality and HIV/AIDS rates drastically reduce life expectancy, especially in developing nations.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add region-specific models (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa vs. Europe)
- Include more socio-political and environmental indicators
- Run VIF checks for multicollinearity
- Introduce regularization models (Ridge/Lasso)
- Build a Shiny dashboard for visualization and user interaction
